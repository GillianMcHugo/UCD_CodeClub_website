UCD_CodeClub is a peer-led support group with the goal of helping UCD PhD students learn the necessary bioinformatics skills to carry out their research in a friendly, supportive environment. We are currently focusing on R, following the ['R for Data Science'](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ "See book") book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Join the [mailing list](http://bit.ly/join_CC) or [follow](https://twitter.com/UCD_CodeClub "@UCD_CodeClub") for updates.
